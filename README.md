## Inspiration/Process

Small iteration on the [previous week](https://github.com/s-ahal/DW_W3_What-are-You). This already used a custom API, but I made the object list persistent in the backend.
I used Replit as my development environment again. The website runs off a Node server using Express. The list of objects returned is now a global variable that is updated every time a user makes a request to the server.
